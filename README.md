# Significance-of-bit-in-Image-Steganography
Now we are making use of two methods for image to image steganography. As we are already aware that individual combinations of pixels form an image. Each pixel is associated with RGB(Red Green Blue) values. A pixel takes 3 bytes, one for each color of RGB and each byte consists of 8 bits. For image to image steganography, image 1 will be merged with image 2. In this case, we are taking 4 bits from image 1 and 4 bits from image 2. This forms a new stegano image which combines the first four bits from the second image and next four bits from the first image.  However, we are appending four zeros in the last 4 bits of the final image in order to increase the brightness. Regardless of using the least bit algorithm, we still can observe some level of distortions affecting the quality of the final stegano image. Hence, the second method overcomes this problem by using the first two bits of image 1 and the first six bits of image 2.  The final stego image combines the first six bits of the second image and the first two bits of the first image. In this case, too six zeros will be appended, thereby producing a better quality of the final image  adding more brightness to the image.
